## Abstract

This paper constructs non-cooperative and cooperative game models to analyze the competition between traditional taxi drivers and online ride-hailing services at airports. We establish income functions to explore the conditions under which both types of games reach Nash equilibrium. The study conducts empirical analysis utilizing actual survey data from Beijing Capital International Airport, providing insights into driver behavior and market dynamics in the presence of platform-based ride-hailing competition.

## Key Contributions

- Constructed non-cooperative and cooperative game models
- Established income functions for Nash equilibrium analysis
- Conducted empirical analysis with Beijing Capital International Airport data
- Analyzed competition dynamics between taxis and ride-hailing services
