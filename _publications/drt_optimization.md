## Abstract

This paper explores demand responsive transit (DRT) route optimization and scheduling models for urban transport hubs. We develop mathematical models and solution algorithms to optimize route design and vehicle scheduling for customized bus services. The research addresses the growing need for flexible public transportation systems that can adapt to varying passenger demands, particularly for late-night services connecting major transport hubs to residential areas.

## Key Contributions

- Developed optimization models for DRT route design
- Proposed scheduling algorithms for customized bus services
- Focused on urban transport hub connectivity
- Addressed flexible public transportation system design

## Presentation

Presented at the 2nd International Conference on Civil Engineering, Architecture and Transportation (CEAT 2024) as part of the Urban Futures: Online Research Seminar series at University of Cambridge.
