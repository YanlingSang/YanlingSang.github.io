## Abstract

This paper analyzes the short-run effects of New York City's $1.50 congestion surcharge (introduced January 5, 2025) on for-hire vehicles and subway ridership. Using 11.0M TLC trip records and 57.2M MTA ridership estimates, we applied a two-way fixed effects difference-in-differences design with OD-pair and temporal fixed effects. Our findings reveal divergent platform responses: Uber trips declined 6% while Lyft increased 2-5%, and subway ridership rose 1%, indicating partial modal substitution from ride-hailing to public transit. We identified heterogeneous impacts across trip types: short trips declined 9% and low-fare rides decreased 35%, while base fares increased though driver pay gains remained limited.

## Key Findings

- Subway ridership rose 1%, indicating modal substitution
- Short trips declined 9%, low-fare rides decreased 35%
- Applied two-way fixed effects difference-in-differences design
- Analyzed 11M TLC trip records and 57M MTA ridership estimates
